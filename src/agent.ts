//     - Use the read-file tool to read the contents of files.
//     - Use the write-file tool to write contents to files.
//     - Use the restore-folder tool to restore backed up folders if need be.
//     - Use the restore-file tool to restore backed up files if need be.
//     - Use the plan tool to create a plan for executing tasks.
